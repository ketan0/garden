# Ketan's Digital Garden

This is the source code for my digital garden. I generate the garden from my org-mode notes, uploading them to a neo4j database using [./org2neo4j.py](./org2neo4j.py). I then pull down nodes+links from Neo4j into my digital garden web app, which displays the notes in various formats.
